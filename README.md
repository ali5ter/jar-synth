# Jar Synth Eagle files

Inspired by Micheal Rucci's excellent Jar Synth
(www.handmadeelectronicinstruments.com). This is my attempt at reverse
engineering his creation and making my own.

This is an Eagle project to illustrate the circuit.

My prototype, like Micheal's is soldered in a 3D 'dead bug' style. However, in
an attempt to get to grips with Eagle, I'm attempting to produce a PCB.
